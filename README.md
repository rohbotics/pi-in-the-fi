Pifi uses NetworkManager to do the heavy lifting under the hood.

The command line tool is `pifi`:
```
Usage:
  pifi status                   Shows if the device is in AP mode or connected to a network
  pifi add <ssid> <password>    Adds a connection to scan/connect to on bootup (needs sudo)
  pifi remove <ssid>            Remove this network (may interfere with ssh)
  pifi list seen                Lists the SSIDs that see seen during bootup
  pifi list pending             Lists the SSIDs that still need to configured in NetworkManager
  pifi set-hostname <hostname>  Set the hostname of the system, also deletes existing AP mode configurations
  pifi --version                Prints the version of pifi on your system

Options:
  -h --help    Show this help message and exit
  --version    Show pifi version and exit
```

Pifi runs a script at boot up that does the following by default:
* Determine if there is wifi device capable of access point mode
* Scan for visible access points, and save the SSIDs to `/var/lib/pifi/seen_ssids`
* Go through any pending connections in `/var/lib/pifi/pending`, and see if any are visiable
* If any of the pending connections are visible, connect to them, and remove them from pending
* Otherwise look for an existing AP mode definiton and start it
* If there is no existing AP mode definition create one with the configuration in `/etc/pifi/default_ap.em` (SSID:`<HOSTNAME><4HEX>`   and password:'robotseverywhere'). (Where `<HOSTNAME>` is the hostname of the system and `<4HEX>` is the last 4 digits of the device mac address.)
* If AP mode was not started, and a button is configured, wait for a button press to start AP mode 

## Connecting to a network while in AP mode
Connect to the ap mode wifi (default `<HOSTNAME><4HEX>`, password robotseverywhere) on your laptop. (Where `<HOSTNAME>` is the hostname of the system and `<4HEX>` is the last 4 digits of the device mac address.)

SSH into the device with `ssh ubuntu@10.42.0.1`. 

Once logged into the device, run `sudo pifi add WIFI_SSID PASSWORD`, and reboot `sudo reboot`.

Your device should now be connected to your network.  

## Using a Button to Start AP Mode
When pifi starts without AP mode (because it connected to an existing network), if there is an input device specified in `pifi.conf` it will wait for a `KEY_CONFIG` press and start AP mode.

On Magni, the input device is the `gpio-keys` driver, connected to a button on the sonar board. This allows the button to show up as a input device, with a name specified in the device tree file. The same name should be specified in `pifi.conf`, so that pifi can grab that device and listen for events. On a event that matches a `KEY_CONFIG` press, 

## Installation
The recommended way to install is from debs. The apt source at https://packages.ubiquityrobotics.com/ has the packages.

If that source is configured on your system, simply run `sudo apt install pifi`.

To install from source, run `sudo pip3 install .` in the pifi directory after cloning this repo.

## Dependencies
Note: Don't worry about dependencies if you are installing from debs, they will be installed automatically.

This package depends on python3-networkmanager, python3-empy, and python3-yaml.

python3-networkmanager is not availible in the standard ubuntu/debian repos, so you will have install it from `pip3 install python-networkmanager`, or use the debian package from https://packages.ubiquityrobotics.com/. More info [here](debian/build-dependencies.md)

## Configuration

If you want to change the behavior of pifi, a few options are availible to tweak.

The main configuration file is a YAML file at `/etc/pifi/pifi.conf`.

The default configuration file is:
```yaml
# YAML configuration file for pifi

# Should pifi delete other ap mode configurations in NetworkManager?
# Default: True
# If true, during the next boot where there are no networks availble 
# pifi will delete existing connections, and create a new default one
delete_existing_ap_connections: True

# The network interface to use for AP mode
# Default: any
# If set to any pifi will pick one automatically
ap_device: any

# The network interface to use for connecting out
# Default: any
# If set to any pifi will pick one automatically
client_device: any

# Path to a Linux LED device to use
# ex: /sys/class/leds/led0
status_led: None

# Name of a user input device to use
# ex: "Keyboard 5"
button_device_name: None
```


The settings of the default AP that pifi creates are also configurable. `/etc/pifi/default_ap.em` contains and empy template of the json that represents the connection settings.

The varibles passed into the template are the hostname of the system (hostname), the MAC address of the device (mac), and a newly generated UUIDv4 (uuid_str).

This is the default configuration:
```
{
    "connection": {
        "id": "Pifi AP Mode",
        "type": "802-11-wireless",
        "autoconnect": "False",
        "uuid": "@(uuid_str)"
    },

    "802-11-wireless": {
        "mode": "ap",
        "security": "802-11-wireless-security",
        "ssid": "@(hostname)@(mac.replace(":", "")[-4:])"
    },

    "802-11-wireless-security": {
        "key-mgmt": "wpa-psk",
        "psk": "robotseverywhere"
    },

    "ipv4": {
        "method": "shared"
    },
    "ipv6": {
        "method": "ignore"
    }
}

```

Empy uses the template format `@()` with python expressions inside of the parenthesis.

The `mac.replace(":", "")[-4:]` gets the last 4 digits of the MAC address after removing colons.

## Interfacing
Your code can interface with pifi via the files in `/var`.

`/var/lib/pifi/pending` is a JSON file that contains a list of wifi connections that should be activated. The connections should be JSON serializations of the NetworkManager connection configuration. 

Example contents of `/var/lib/pifi/pending`:
```
[
  {
    "ipv4": {
      "method": "auto"
    },
    "802-11-wireless-security": {
      "key-mgmt": "wpa-psk",
      "psk": "supersecurepassword"
    },
    "connection": {
      "type": "802-11-wireless",
      "autoconnect": true,
      "id": "wifi",
      "uuid": "ce17378f-b187-48ab-af93-48613e88a5e5"
    },
    "802-11-wireless": {
      "mode": "infrastructure",
      "ssid": "wifi",
      "security": "802-11-wireless-security"
    },
    "ipv6": {
      "method": "auto"
    }
  }
]
```

`/var/lib/pifi/seen_ssids` is a plain text file with the list of SSIDs seen when pifi was starting up, as many cards can't scan once they start AP mode.

Example contents of file:
```
xfinitywifi
xfinitywifi
xfinitywifi
Aleopile
Jhuangdds
Requilme-CA2
Linksys New
xfinitywifi
Aleopile
Jhuangdds
Requilme-CA2
ATT9C8eh3A
HOME-616E-2.4
HOME-99EB
linksys
xfinitywifi
```

Notice that the SSIDs can be duplicated (there will be one entry per AP).
